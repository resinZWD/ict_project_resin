<p>What is a Backup?
  A backup simply means making one or more copies of your data.<br>
  
  For example, if you have a folder of photos stored on the hard-drive of your laptop, you might back them up by copying them to a CD-R.</p>
  <br> <p>Why Backup Your Data?<br>
    If you delete a file by accident, your computer breaks, your laptop is stolen, or your business burns to the ground, having a backup copy means that you have not lost your precious data. You can recover your lost files and continue working.<br>
    Most businesses use computers to store very important data (customer records, financial information, designs for products, etc.) If this data is lost, the business could possibly have to close. Backing-up business data is essential.</p><br>
<p>How Are Backups Created?<br>
  Personal backups of the data on your hard-drive can be made by…<br>
  Burning files to a CD-R<br>
  Copying files to an external hard-drive<br>
  Copying the files to another computer on a network<br>
  Businesses backup essential data by...<br>
  Making copies of data very regularly<br>
  Using large-capacity media such as magnetic tape<br>
  Keeping old copies of backups, just in case<br>
  Automating the system so that nobody forgets to do it!<br>
  Keeping backup media off-site (in case of fire or theft)</p>
