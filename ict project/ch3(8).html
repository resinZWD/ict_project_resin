<p>Optical storage devices save data as patterns of dots that can be read using light. A laser beam is the usual light source.<br>

  The data on the storage medium is read by bouncing the laser beam off the surface of the medium. If the beam hits a dot it is reflected back differently to how it would be if there were no dot. This difference can be detected, so the data can be read.<br>
  
  Dots can be created using the laser beam (for media that is writable such as CD-Rs). The beam is used in a high-power mode to actually mark the surface of the medium, making a dot. This process is known as 'burning' data onto a disc.<br></p>
  <p div class="topic"><br>Read-Only Optical Discs<br></p>
  <img src="">
  <p>Read-only optical discs have data written onto them when they are manufactured. This data cannot be changed.
  <p div class="topic"><br>CD-ROM<br></p>
  Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) discs can hold around 800MB of data. The data cannot be altered (non-volatile), so cannot be accidently deleted. CD-ROMs are random-access devices.
  <br>CD-ROMs are used to distribute all sorts of data: software (e.g. office applications or games), music, electronic books (e.g. an encyclopaedia with sound and video.)
  <p div class="topic"><br>DVD-ROM<br></p><p>
  Digital Versatile Disc - Read-Only Memory (DVD-ROM) discs can hold around 4.7GB of data (a dual-layer DVD can hold twice that). DVD-ROMs are random-access devices.<br>
  DVD-ROMs are used in the same way as CD-ROMs (see above) but, since they can hold more data, they are also used to store high-quality video.<br></p>
  <p div class="topic">High Capacity Optical Discs<br>
  </p><p div class="topic"> Blu-Ray<br></p>
  Blu-Ray disks are a recent replacement for DVDs. A Blu-Ray disc can hold 25 - 50GB of data (a dual-layer Blu-Ray disc can hold twice that). Blu-Ray discs are random-access devices.<br>
  Blu-Ray discs are used in the same way as DVD-ROMs (see above) but, since they can hold more data, they are also used to store very high-quality, high-definition (HD) video.
  <p div class="topic">HD DVD</p><br>
  High-density DVD (HD-DVD) discs can hold around 15GB of data (a dual-layer HD-DVD can hold twice that). HD-DVDs are random-access devices.<br>
  HD-DVD discs are used in the same way as DVD-ROMs (see above) but, since they can hold more data, they are also used to store very high-quality, high-definition (HD) video.<br>
  Recordable Optical Discs<br>
  Recordable optical discs can have data written onto them ('burnt') by a computer user using a special disc drive (a disc ‘burner’).<br>
  <p div class="topic">CD-R and DVD-R</p><br>
  CD-Recordable (CD-R) and DVD-recordable (DVD-R) discs can have data burnt onto them, but not erased. You can keep adding data until the disc is full, but you cannot remove any data or re-use a full disc.<br>
  <p div class="topic"> CD-RW and DVD-RW</p><br>
  CD-ReWritable (CD-RW) and DVD-ReWritable (DVD-RW) discs, unlike CD-Rs and DVD-Rs, can have data burnt onto them and also erased so that the discs can be re-used.<br>
  <p div class="topic">DVD-RAM</p><br>
  DVD-Random Access Memory (DVD-RAM) discs are a type of re-writable DVD. They often come in a floppy-disc style case (to protect the disc).<br>
  
  DVD-RAM discs have a similar capacity to a normal DVD, holding 4.7GB of data. DVD-RAM discs are random-access devices.<br>
  DVD-RAM discs are used in many camcorders (video recording cameras).<br>
  
  The discs are much higher quality than normal DVD-RWs and can reliably store data for up to 30 years. This means that they are often used for video and data back-up and archiving.
